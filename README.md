# React Redux Booklist

## What I Learned
- Reducers- function that returns a piece of the application state.
- Containers/Smart Components- components that has direct access to state produce by Redux.
- Use Redux connect in a container to connect React and Redux.
- Action Creator- every action needs to run through all reducers.
- Need to set a defualt state to avoid errors- React will send activities through the reducers
on page load, so a default state or conditional is needed to handle null state and prevent errors.
